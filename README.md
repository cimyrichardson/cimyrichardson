### 🚀 About Me

I'm a passionate IT student with strong adaptability skills and a keen interest in emerging technologies. I enjoy tackling challenges that help me grow both technically and professionally. When I'm not coding, you'll find me contributing to educational projects, designing graphics, or mentoring peers in tech.
